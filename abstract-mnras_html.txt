We train a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the gas-phase metallicity (<i>Z</i>) of galaxies derived from spectroscopic information (<i>Z</i> ≡ 12 + log(O/H)) using only three-band <i>gri</i> images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. When trained and tested on 128 × 128-pixel images, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of <i>Z</i><sub>pred</sub> − <i>Z</i><sub>true</sub> is only 0.085 dex, vastly outperforming a trained random forest algorithm on the same data set (RMSE = 0.130 dex). The amount of scatter in <i>Z</i><sub>pred</sub> − <i>Z</i><sub>true</sub> decreases with increasing image resolution in an intuitive manner. We are able to use CNN-predicted <i>Z</i><sub>pred</sub> and independently measured stellar masses to recover a mass-metallicity relation with 0.10 dex scatter. Because our predicted MZR shows no more scatter than the empirical MZR, the difference between <i>Z</i><sub>pred</sub> and <i>Z</i><sub>true</sub> can not be due to purely random error. This suggests that the CNN has learned a representation of the gas-phase metallicity, from the optical imaging, beyond what is accessible with oxygen spectral lines.
