We use a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the gas-phase metallicity (Z) of galaxies measured using spectroscopic information from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using a full sample of ~130,000 RGB (irg) 128 x 128 pixel images, we find a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.085 dex between predicted and true metallicities, which significantly surpasses the performance of a random forest algorithm (RMSE = 0.130 dex) trained on broadband photometry of the same data set. We construct a low scatter (0.1 dex) mass-metallicity relation (MZR) using the CNN-predicted metallcity and the stellar mass inferred from the spectroscopy. Because our predicted MZR shows a similar level of scatter as the empirical MZR, the difference between the CNN-predicted and spectroscopically derived metallicity can not be due to purely random error. This suggests that the CNN has learned a representation of the gas-phase metallicity, from the optical imaging, beyond what is accessible with oxygen spectral lines.
